- The Single Page Site module does some cool stuff that would otherwise take a lot of hacking...
   - it lets you order your pages based on the order of your navigation menu (i.e outputs all nodes, sorted by menu weight, without using views).
   - it automatically links all your pages to the menu with anchor tags, so when you click a link on the top navigation, you scroll down to the appropriate place on the page.

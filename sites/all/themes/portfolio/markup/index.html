		SHAKESPEARE AT TULANE UNIVERSITY

		Tulane University School of Liberal Arts is honored to have been selected as the state of Louisiana host site for First Folio! The Book that Gave Us Shakespeare, a national traveling exhibition of the Shakespeare First Folio, one of the world’s most treasured books. The exhibition honors Shakespeare in 2016, on the 400th anniversary of his death.
		The Folger Shakespeare Library, Washington, DC, in partnership with the Cincinnati Museum Center and the American Library Association, is touring a First Folio of Shakespeare to all 50 states, Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico. Published seven years after Shakespeare’s death, in 1623, by two of his fellow actors, the First Folio is one of the most important books ever printed. The volume presents thirty-six of Shakespeare’s plays in a deluxe format. Without the First Folio, we would not have the texts of eighteen of Shakespeare’s plays, including Macbeth, Julius Caesar, Twelfth Night, The Tempest, Antony and Cleopatra, The Comedy of Errors, and As You Like It.
		The exhibition will be installed at the Angela Gregory Gallery of the Newcomb Art Museum, on Tulane University’s uptown campus, May 9-31 and is open to the public.
